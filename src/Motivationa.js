                • His resilience & grit earned Mukesh Ambani & KM Birla’s massive respect. Infact they even launched AM Naik’s biography ‘The Nationalist’ in 2017. L&T played a major role in India’s 1st Nuclear plant, Chandrayaan II, Mars Orbiter Mission & several others!

                • AM Naik : ” I’m devoted, committed and married to L&T. Do you know that in my first 21 years in the company, I didn’t take a single day off? My parents were considerate, too. My father passed away on a Sunday, a holiday, and two years later, my mother died on August 15. Even they didn’t want their son to take leave!”
            </p>
