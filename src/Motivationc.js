Born in South Africa, Musk’s father was a mechanical engineer and his mother was a popular model. Musk began his entrepreneurial ventures very young – at age ten, he bought his first computer. He learned computer programming on his own and by the age of twelve, had created a game called Blaster which he sold for US$500. Musk felt that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States from Canada than from South Africa. So, in 1989, he took admission to Queen’s University in Canada while seventeen. In 1992, Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania. After earning a bachelor’s degree in economics, he pursued a second undergraduate degree in physics. The thirst for knowledge was inborn in Musk, something that is not often seen in people.
